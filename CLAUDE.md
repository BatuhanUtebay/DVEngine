### Key Data Structures

The main application (`DVGApp`) manages these core data structures:
- `nodes`: Dictionary of all story nodes by ID
- `player_stats`: Character attributes (health, strength, etc.)
- `player_inventory`: List of items the player possesses
- `story_flags`: Boolean flags for tracking story states
- `variables`: Numeric variables (gold, counters, etc.)
- `quests`: Quest tracking system
- `enemies`: Combat system enemies
- `timers`: Game timer objects

### Template System
- Templates are JSON files in `dvge/templates/` that define pre-configured projects
- Applied via `dvge/core/template_manager.py`
- Templates can set up nodes, variables, stats, and other project data

### Export System
- Games export to single HTML files with embedded JavaScript
- All media assets are base64 encoded into the HTML
- Uses validation system to check for errors before export

## UX Enhancement Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Voice Acting Pipeline (Priority: High)
1. **Core Voice System** (`dvge/features/voice_system.py`)
   - VoiceManager class with TTS provider abstraction
   - Voice asset metadata and storage management
   - Character voice profiling and consistency checking

2. **TTS Provider Integration** (`dvge/ai/tts_providers.py`)
   - Abstract base class for TTS providers
   - Azure Cognitive Services, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, OpenAI TTS
   - Voice caching and batch generation capabilities

3. **UI Integration** (`dvge/ui/panels/voice_panel.py`)
   - Voice library browser with preview functionality
   - Character-to-voice assignment interface
   - Batch voice generation and export tools

4. **Export Enhancement**
   - Extend `html_exporter.py` to embed voice assets
   - HTML5 audio controls with dialogue synchronization
   - Fallback text display for accessibility

### Phase 2: Visual Novel Mode (Priority: High)
1. **Sprite Management** (`dvge/features/sprite_system.py`)
   - Character sprite library with expression/pose variants
   - Layer-based composition system for complex characters
   - Animation support (simple transitions, breathing effects)

2. **Scene Composition** (`dvge/features/background_system.py`)
   - Background library with parallax support
   - Scene transition effects (fade, slide, wipe, custom)
   - Environmental audio integration

3. **Visual Novel Exporter** (`dvge/core/visual_novel_exporter.py`)
   - Alternative HTML export mode for VN-style presentation
   - CSS-based character positioning and transitions
   - Touch/mobile-optimized controls

### Phase 3: Accessibility Suite (Priority: Medium)
1. **Accessibility Core** (`dvge/features/accessibility_system.py`)
   - WCAG compliance validation and reporting
   - Automated accessibility testing for exported games
   - Theme system extension for high contrast and colorblind support

2. **Enhanced Export** (`dvge/core/accessibility_exporter.py`)
   - Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation implementation
   - Screen reader optimizations

### Phase 4: Community Marketplace (Priority: Medium)
1. **Backend Integration** (`dvge/features/marketplace_system.py`)
   - RESTful API client for content repository
   - Authentication and user profile management
   - Content validation and metadata handling

2. **Content Management** (`dvge/features/content_upload.py`)
   - Upload wizard for templates, assets, and complete projects
   - Content categorization and tagging system
   - Community rating and review system

## Important Patterns

1. **Circular Import Prevention**: Many imports are done within functions to avoid circular dependencies
2. **State Management**: All significant actions should call `state_manager.save_state()` for undo support  
3. **Node References**: Nodes reference each other by ID strings, not direct object references
4. **Feature Integration**: Advanced features are optional and gracefully degrade if unavailable
5. **Canvas System**: UI elements store `canvas_item_ids` for tracking visual components
6. **UX Enhancement Integration**: New UX features extend existing systems without breaking compatibility
7. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features degrade gracefully when dependencies are unavailable
